Gather 500 black and white pictures of two categories. Do not go for cats and dogs. Make the data preprocessing (gather them, make them all black and white, resize them to be in same shapeâ€¦). This will be your dataset. Give it some care, you will also use it later.

1. Build a model of KNN (k- neighbor clustering) using basic scientific packages. **DO NOT** use already implemented libraries like scikit-learn or pytorch.
2. Same thing in SVM.
3. Same thing in Logistic Regression.
4. Same thing in NNs.
